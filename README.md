# Project Title: Comprehensive Bank Loan Data Analysis and Visualization

I recently completed an extensive data analysis project on a bank loan dataset, focusing on key metrics such as total loan applications, funded amounts, payment collections, interest rates, and more. The main objectives were to derive meaningful insights, identify trends, and visualize the data for improved decision-making.

ðŸ“Š Tools and Technologies:

Data Querying: Utilized pgAdmin to write and execute SQL queries for data extraction and analysis. This involved using complex queries to filter, aggregate, and join tables, ensuring a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
Data Visualization: Leveraged Power BI to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards. These visualizations provided clear insights and facilitated easier interpretation of the data.
ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights:

Loan Performance Analysis: Analyzed the performance of loans based on employment length, home ownership status, and loan purpose. Identified which groups had higher rates of successful repayments.
Trend Identification: Discovered trends in interest rates and loan amounts across different grades and terms, providing insights into lending practices and borrower behavior.

Risk Assessment: Assessed the risk levels associated with different borrower profiles by analyzing the relationship between debt-to-income (DTI) ratios and loan statuses.

Temporal Patterns: Investigated payment histories and credit pull dates to understand temporal patterns in loan repayment behavior.
